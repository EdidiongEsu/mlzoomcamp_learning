## Description of Data
Churn rate is a marketing metric that describes the number of customers who leave a business over a specific time period. . Every user is assigned a prediction value that estimates their state of churn at any given time. This value is based on:

User demographic information
Browsing behavior
Historical purchase data among other information
It factors in our unique and proprietary predictions of how long a user will remain a customer. This score is updated every day for all users who have a minimum of one conversion.
